Parking Garage Application

This repository contains the documentation for our Parking Garage Application project, developed as part of the SCS252 - Software Modeling course at Cairo University. The project applies software engineering principles such as SOLID and common Design Patterns, and includes both requirements and design specifications.

Repository Files

Project's SOLID and Design Patterns Description.docx
Explains how we applied SOLID principles in our class diagrams and where design patterns (Singleton, Strategy) are used.

SCS252-SoftwareRequirementsSpecifications.docx (SRS)
Contains the requirements specification, including the system purpose, scope, functional requirements, and use case model.

SCS252-SoftwareDesignSpecifications.docx (SDS)
Includes the design specification, with class diagrams, sequence diagrams, important algorithms (First-Come-First-Serve & Best-Fit), and classâ€“sequence usage mapping.

Main Features
